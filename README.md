## Oddities

Tempo starts the day with every user being behind by 7Â½ hours (or your configured daily work hours). TempoFlex adapts to this by ignoring today's hours if today is a working day. If it's a UK Bank Holiday, or a weekend, it'll continue to count today's hours (although you probably should take a break...)
 
## Acknowledgements

[Tempo}(https://www.tempo.io/jira-project-management-tool) is a Jira plugin for recording time, among many other things. The Tempo name is theirs, and I'm in no way affiliated - I just made a tool that I found useful.
